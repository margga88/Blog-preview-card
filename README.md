## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This time this was more about polishing what I already knew and testing a bit the methodology of Cube CCS, as well as starting to build from the mobile aspect instead of desktop first. It felt a bit awkward to work on both perspectives but I hope I improve overtime with practice.

### Continued development

- I'd like to continue practicing the methodlogy and building my templates, so I could finish these projects just as fast as I did this one. 

### Useful resources

- [Cube CSS](https://blog.logrocket.com/cube-css-alternative-css-methodology/) - This helped me to get started with the Cube CSS methodology.
